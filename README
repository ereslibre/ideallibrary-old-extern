This repository contains applications as if they were external to the Ideal Library. If you are
writing an application (or library) that depends on the Ideal Library, this is a good set of
examples on how to set it up.

Compiling examples
==================

Say we want to compile "mediaPlayer" example.

# cd mediaPlayer
# ../waf configure
# ../waf

Running examples
================

We have run the previous commands and we are on "mediaPlayer" folder.

# build/default/mediaPlayer
